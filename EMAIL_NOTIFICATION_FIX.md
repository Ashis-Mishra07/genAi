# Email Notification System - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to send artisan notification email: <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Cannot POST /webhook/artisan-order-notification</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

**Root Cause**: The n8n webhook endpoint is either:
1. Not active in your n8n instance
2. The n8n instance is sleeping (Render free tier)
3. Webhook path mismatch
4. n8n instance is down or misconfigured

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging in `lib/email-service.ts`

**Customer Order Confirmation:**
```typescript
‚úÖ Before: Generic error logs
‚úÖ After: Detailed logging with:
  - HTTP status codes
  - Customer details (name, email)
  - Order details (number, total, items)
  - Webhook URL being called
  - Full error context
```

**Artisan Notifications:**
```typescript
‚úÖ Before: Simple error message
‚úÖ After: Professional logging with:
  - Artisan details (name, email)
  - Order number and product count
  - Total earnings for the artisan
  - HTTP response details
  - Webhook URL verification
```

### 2. Improved Order API Error Handling in `app/api/orders/route.ts`

**Email Notification Flow:**
```typescript
‚úÖ Before: Failed silently or logged basic error
‚úÖ After:
  - Counts successful vs failed email sends
  - Logs each failure with context
  - Continues order creation even if emails fail
  - Clear success/failure reporting
  - Professional console output with emojis
```

**Example Output:**
```
üì¨ Sending notifications to 2 artisan(s) for order ORD-12345
üìß Sending artisan notification to artisan1@example.com for order ORD-12345
‚úÖ Artisan notification email sent successfully to artisan1@example.com
   Order: ORD-12345 | Products: 3 | Total: ‚Çπ1,500.00
   
üìß Sending artisan notification to artisan2@example.com for order ORD-12345
‚ùå Failed to send artisan notification email (HTTP 404): Cannot POST /webhook/artisan-order-notification
Webhook URL: https://n8n-1-lpl8.onrender.com/webhook/artisan-order-notification
Artisan: Jane Artisan <artisan2@example.com>
Order: ORD-12345 with 2 products

üìß Order email notifications completed for order: ORD-12345 (1 success, 1 failed)
‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to send 1 artisan notification email(s) - Order created successfully but notifications failed
   Email 1 failure: Webhook error: Cannot POST /webhook/artisan-order-notification
```

### 3. Created Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide

**New File**: `N8N_WEBHOOK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

Includes:
- Quick fix checklist
- Common issues and solutions
- Testing procedures
- Alternative email service options (Nodemailer, SendGrid, Resend)
- Production security recommendations
- Manual webhook testing with curl commands

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ Graceful Degradation
- Orders are created successfully even if email notifications fail
- System continues to function normally
- Errors are logged for debugging but don't break the flow

### ‚úÖ Detailed Diagnostics
- HTTP status codes in error messages
- Full context (customer/artisan details, order info)
- Webhook URL visibility for debugging
- Success/failure counts

### ‚úÖ Professional Logging
- Emojis for quick visual scanning (üìß ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è üì¨)
- Structured output with clear sections
- Color-coded console output (via emojis)
- Helpful error messages with actionable information

### ‚úÖ Non-Breaking Behavior
- Email failures don't prevent order creation
- Customers still get their orders
- Artisans can see orders in dashboard
- In-app notifications still work

## How to Fix the Webhook Issue

### Option 1: Activate n8n Workflow (Recommended)

1. **Login to n8n**: https://n8n-1-lpl8.onrender.com
2. **Navigate to Workflows**
3. **Find**: "Artisan Order Notification Email"
4. **Toggle**: Make sure it's **ACTIVE** (green toggle)
5. **Test**: Place a test order

### Option 2: Test Webhook Manually

```bash
curl -X POST https://n8n-1-lpl8.onrender.com/webhook/artisan-order-notification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "orderNumber": "TEST-001",
    "artisanName": "Test Artisan",
    "artisanEmail": "your-email@gmail.com",
    "customerName": "Test Customer",
    "products": [{
      "id": "test-1",
      "name": "Handmade Pottery",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 750,
      "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
    }],
    "shippingAddress": {
      "fullName": "Test Customer",
      "addressLine1": "123 Test Street",
      "city": "Mumbai",
      "state": "Maharashtra",
      "postalCode": "400001",
      "country": "India",
      "phone": "+919876543210"
    },
    "paymentMethod": "cod",
    "createdAt": "2025-11-01T12:00:00.000Z",
    "dashboardUrl": "http://localhost:3000/artisan/dashboard"
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Artisan notification email sent",
  "orderNumber": "TEST-001"
}
```

### Option 3: Wake Up n8n Instance

If using Render free tier, the instance may be sleeping:

```bash
# Wake up the instance
curl https://n8n-1-lpl8.onrender.com/healthz

# Wait 30 seconds for instance to start
sleep 30

# Then place your order
```

### Option 4: Switch to Alternative Email Service

If n8n continues to fail, implement a direct email service:

**Using Nodemailer (Gmail)**:
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

**Using SendGrid**:
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

**Using Resend** (Modern, Recommended):
```bash
npm install resend
```

See `N8N_WEBHOOK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for implementation details.

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start your dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Place a test order** at: http://localhost:3000/customer/checkout
3. **Watch the console logs** for:
   ```
   üì¶ POST /api/orders - Order creation request received
   ‚úÖ Authenticated user: customer@example.com
   üìã Order data received: { itemsCount: 2, total: 1500, ... }
   üîÑ Calling createOrder function...
   ‚úÖ Order created successfully: ORD-12345
   üì¨ Sending notifications to 1 artisan(s) for order ORD-12345
   üìß Sending artisan notification to artisan@example.com for order ORD-12345
   ```
4. **Expected outcomes**:
   - ‚úÖ Order is created successfully
   - ‚úÖ Success screen appears
   - ‚úÖ Auto-redirect to orders page
   - ‚úÖ Email sent (if webhook works) OR detailed error logged (if webhook fails)

## Production Recommendations

### 1. Email Service Reliability
- Use dedicated email service (SendGrid, Resend, AWS SES)
- Implement retry logic for failed emails
- Queue emails for async processing
- Monitor email delivery rates

### 2. Webhook Monitoring
- Set up health checks for n8n instance
- Implement webhook retries
- Add fallback email service
- Log all email attempts to database

### 3. Error Tracking
- Integrate Sentry or similar for error tracking
- Set up alerts for email failures
- Monitor webhook response times
- Track email delivery success rates

### 4. User Experience
- Don't block order creation on email failures
- Show in-app notifications as backup
- Provide order confirmation page
- Email order details later if webhook fails
