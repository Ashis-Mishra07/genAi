# 🚨 IMPORTANT: Restart Development Server Required

## The Issue
Turbopack (Next.js dev server) is caching the old Prisma client module. Even though we've regenerated the Prisma client, the server needs a full restart to pick up the changes.

## ✅ Solution - Follow These Steps:

### Step 1: Stop the Development Server
In the terminal where your dev server is running:
1. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server
2. Wait for it to fully shut down

### Step 2: Start the Development Server Again
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Chatbot
1. Open your browser and go to the artisan dashboard
2. Click the floating chatbot button (bottom-right corner)
3. Type a message: "How many products do I have?"
4. You should get a response without any Prisma errors!

## 🔧 What We Fixed

1. ✅ **Created Prisma Singleton** (`lib/db/prisma.ts`)
   - Prevents multiple database connections
   - Follows Next.js best practices
   - Properly handles global state

2. ✅ **Updated API Routes** to use the singleton:
   - `/api/artisan/chatbot/route.ts`
   - `/api/artisan/chatbot/voice/route.ts`

3. ✅ **Added Postinstall Script** (`package.json`)
   - Automatically generates Prisma client on `npm install`
   - Ensures build process includes Prisma generation

4. ✅ **Generated Prisma Client** multiple times
   - Latest generation completed successfully

## 💡 Why Just Restart?

Turbopack (Next.js 15's new bundler) aggressively caches modules. When we:
- Generate a new Prisma client
- Create new files that import Prisma
- Clear the `.next` folder

The dev server needs a **full restart** to:
- Re-resolve all modules
- Pick up the new Prisma client
- Rebuild the module graph

A simple file save or hot reload won't work because the Prisma client is loaded at the module level.

## 🎯 Quick Restart Command

```powershell
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C), then:
npm run dev
```

That's it! The chatbot will work after the restart.

## 🧪 Testing the Chatbot

After restarting, test these queries in different languages:

**English:**
- "How many products do I have?"
- "Show me my recent orders"
- "What are my sales this month?"

**Hindi:**
- "मेरे कितने उत्पाद हैं?"
- "मेरे हाल के ऑर्डर दिखाओ"

**Bengali:**
- "আমার কতগুলি পণ্য আছে?"

All should work without errors! 🎉

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Option 1: Complete Clean Restart
```powershell
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Clear everything
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules/.prisma
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules/@prisma

# Reinstall and regenerate
npm install
npx prisma generate

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Check Prisma Client Location
```powershell
# Should return True
Test-Path "node_modules/@prisma/client/index.js"
```

### Option 3: Check for Multiple Node Processes
```powershell
# Kill all Node processes
Get-Process -Name node | Stop-Process -Force

# Then start fresh
npm run dev
```

## 📝 Notes

- **Turbopack** is still experimental and has some caching quirks
- Always restart the dev server after Prisma schema changes
- The `postinstall` script ensures Prisma is always ready
- In production, the build script handles Prisma generation automatically

**Status:** Ready to test after restart! 🚀
