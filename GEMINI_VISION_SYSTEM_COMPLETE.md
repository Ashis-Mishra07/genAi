```typescript
// NEW METHOD: Gemini Vision Analysis
async analyzeProductImage(imageData: string) {
  // Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to analyze uploaded product images
  // Returns: product type, background removal needs, model recommendations
}

// NEW METHOD: Real Content Generation  
async generatePhotoshootContent(prompt: string, productInfo: any, style: string) {
  // Integrates with ContentGeneratorTool for dynamic content

}

// NEW METHOD: Realistic Photoshoot Generation
async generateRealisticPhotoshoot(prompt, productInfo, style, dimensions, content) {
  // Creates realistic photoshoot concepts instead of hardcoded CSS

}
```

### Enhanced Execute Method Flow:

createProductDescriptionPrompt() {
  // "Create content that envisions this product being worn/used by real models"
  // "Describe specific photoshoot scenarios"
  // "Include model styling suggestions and pose concepts"
}

// UPDATED: Marketing copy for photoshoot campaigns  
createMarketingCopyPrompt() {
  // "Create photoshoot-inspired brand content"
  // "Focus on how the product photographs on models"
  // "Format as creative brief for professional photoshoot campaign"
}
```

## 🎬 HOW THE NEW SYSTEM WORKS:

  "photoshootConcept": "Street style photoshoot capturing authentic urban lifestyle"
}
```

2. **Real Content Generated:**
```
📝 PHOTOSHOOT BRIEF:
"Envision a casual streetwear model wearing this hoodie in an urban setting.

fit and street style aesthetic. Use natural lighting to capture authentic 
urban lifestyle moments..."
